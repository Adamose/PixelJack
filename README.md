# Origins

Since I started coding I've always wanted to make a blackjack game. However, during my early days the task seemed too daunting so I brushed the idea to the side. However, after learning C++ in one of my classes I found the language to be intuitive and enjoyable which led me to finally take on the project of making my own blackjack game.

# Compilation

The included makefile supports both windows and web compilation. To make an exe go into the src directory and run the "make" command. To compile for HTML5 make sure you have emscripten installed and run the "make web" command instead to get the HTML/JS/WASM files.

# Gameplay

The game normally runs at 30FPS but looks choppy in this gif to save space.
